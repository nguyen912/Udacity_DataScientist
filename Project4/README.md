# Sparkify: Churn Prediction
### 1. Libraries
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Sborn
- Matplotlib
- PySpark
### 2. Project Motivation
- I'm interested in predicting churned users in Sparkify.

### 3. Works
- Do loading and cleaning small subset (128MB) of a full dataset available (12GB)
- Do Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the data and what features are useful for prediction
- Do Feature Engineering for modeling
- Do Modelling using machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees
