# Sparkify: Churn Prediction
### 1. Libraries
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Sborn
- Matplotlib
- PySpark

### 2. Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in predicting customer churn for Sparkify - a music streaming company.

Participating projects:
- Do loading and cleaning small subset (128MB) of a full dataset available (12GB)
- Do Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the data and what features are useful for prediction
- Do Feature Engineering for modeling
- Do Modelling using machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees

### 3. File Descriptions
- Sparkify.ipynb: notebook containing the data analysis.
- Sparkify.html: notebook containing the data analysis include the results as a html file to easy reading.

### 4. Summary
The Random Forest classifier was selected as the best model by evaluating the indices of accuracy and the F1 score. The final model achieves an F1 score and an Accuracy of 0.76.
